    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>Just a short introduction from my side; I'm Sophie, 27 years old and I spent most of my life in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. (That sounds kinda boring). In my spare time, I tend to follow a vicious cycle of eating and excercising. My favorite activities are yoga, rock climbing (the Dutch variant without rocks or mountains, but with plastic walls and grips) and occasionally running for a bit. With food I'm less picky as long as it's vegetarian. </p>
    <p>For the past three years, I've been working at a great company called Usabilla, where - although I didn't code myself - I learned that software development is actually pretty interesting and I might have a shot at becoming a developer myself. It also seems to fit in with my future plans, which are:</p>
    <h2>Plan A</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Come up with a maginificent plan for software that everyone needs.</li>
      <li>Build a company around it and get rich.</li>
      <li>Retire at the age of 35 and spend the rest of my life running a small restaurant named Le Bisou that serves organic food on a beach of some tropical island.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Plan B</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Become a software developer.</li>
      <li>Find a job at a small tech company and work with lots of smart, cool kids that share all of their development smartness with me.</li>
      <li>Become a smart cool kid that writes awesome code for a living.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Plan C</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Become a software developer.</li>
      <li>Find a job at a small tech company and work with lots of smart, cool kids that share all of their development smartness with me.</li>
      <li>Use all of the technical knowledge that I acquired to eventually become a Product Manager.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I very much look forward to meeting you all in person and sharing loads of frustrations, aha-moments and learned lessons.</p>
