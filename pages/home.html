    <h1>Aaaand we're live!</h1>
    <p>Isn't it exciting? Most people that have published something on the internet surely know the feeling that comes with publishing a newborn project. A project that has been nurtured and loved up until the moment that it's ready to take its first steps into the real world as an MVP. Although this is quite a simple website, I feel the same about this page and I'm excited about seeing it live and grow. Over the next two months I plan to at least add/change the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Content for the blog and portfolio pages.</li>
      <li>More background images.</li>
      <li>Some animations to smoothen transitions and increase interactivity.</li>
      <li>Some color.</li>
      <li>Improve accessibility - I know... Should've done this from the start.</li>
      <li>Any other ideas? Let me know through <a href="#contact">the feedback widget</a>!</li>
    </ol>
